## About my Project

The goal of this project was to create a README generator, so that setting up a README.md files would be an easier and quicker process. I have used Node.js to achieve that, as well as the inquirer package. When using my app, the user is asked a series of questions about their project. These answers are then used to generate a markdown file with a name of their choosing. The file includes several sections and a dynamic table of contents to allow easy navigation through it.
