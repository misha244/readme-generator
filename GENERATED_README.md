# Barone Sanitation & Cartage

![MIT badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Description

This project is the new website for my business. My name is Tony Soprano and I work for a North Jersey-based waste management company called Barone Sanitation & Cartage. As a waste consultant, my focus is on environmental cleanup, but I have vast experience and know the ins and out of waste management. I've followed in my father's footsteps in this position and hope that my son will also follow the family tradition. Through our new site, I am hoping to expand our business opportunities and lead the way for waste management companies in the 21st century.
